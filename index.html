            <p>
                Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that
                gaz
                opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
                such thing as an issue.

                Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing
                exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
                changes.
                That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
                translate
                the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
                Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

                They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
                out of
                that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
                the
                person
                is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make
                your
                world,
                it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around to commiserate.

                They said, <br>
                <tag class="villagers">
                    “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
                </tag><br>

                The farmer said,<br>
                <tag class="farmer">
                    “Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know.”
                </tag><br>

                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came
                back
                and said,<br>

                <tag class="villagers">
                    “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
                </tag><br>
                The farmer again said,<br>
                <tag class="farmer">
                    “Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know.”
                </tag><br>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his
                leg.

                The neighbors then said,<br>
                <tag class="villagers">
                    “Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>,”
                </tag><br>

                and the farmer responded, <br>
                <tag class="farmer">
                    “Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know.”
                </tag><br>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
                his
                son because he had a broken leg.

                Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br>
                <tag class="villagers">
                    “Isn’t that great!”
                </tag><br>

                Again, he said,<br>

                <tag class="farmer">
                    “Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know.”
                </tag><br>
                <br>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> —
                because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
                the
                consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.
                <br>

                <tag class="good">Good</tag> and <tag class="bad">Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag
                    class="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="good">good</tag> for bananas.
                Let's not make a big deal out of it...
